2. Create a Spotify Developer account and register your application to get your Client ID and Client Secret.

3. Create a `config.js` file in the root directory with the following content:
```javascript
const config = {
    CLIENT_ID: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    CLIENT_SECRET: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
};
Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET with your actual Spotify API credentials.

4.Open index.html in a web browser.

Note :
This project requires a web server to run properly due to CORS restrictions when making API requests. You can use a simple HTTP server like Python's http.server or Node.js http-server.
For Python:
Copypython -m http.server 8000
For Node.js:

Install http-server: npm install -g http-server
Run: http-server

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

     - `index.html`
     - `styles.css`
     - `app.js`
     - `README.md`
     - `.gitignore`

9. Push your changes to GitHub:
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare project for submission"
git push origin main
Copy
10. Share your GitHub repository link:
 - This is what you'll submit. The repository should contain all necessary files except `config.js`.

By following these steps, anyone who clones your repository can set up and run your project by following the instructions in the README, without exposing your personal API credentials. They'll need to use their own Spotify API credentials in the `config.js` file.

This approach ensures that your project is secure, easily shareable, and runnable on other systems. It also provides clear instructions for setup and usage, which is crucial for project evaluation.
