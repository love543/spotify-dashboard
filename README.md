# Spotify Dashboard

This project is a dashboard that visualizes data from the Spotify API.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/love543/spotify-dashboard.git
cd spotify-dashboard
2. Create a Spotify Developer account and register your application to get your Client ID and Client Secret.

3. Create a `config.js` file in the root directory with the following content:
```javascript
const config = {
    CLIENT_ID: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    CLIENT_SECRET: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
};
Excellent question. To make your project easily runnable on someone else's system, you'll need to package it properly and provide clear instructions. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to prepare your project for submission:

Create a GitHub repository:

Create a new repository on GitHub.
Push your project files to this repository.


Remove sensitive information:

Remove your Spotify API credentials from the code.
Instead, use environment variables or a configuration file.


Create a configuration file:

Create a file named config.js in your project root.
Add the following content:
javascriptCopyconst config = {
    CLIENT_ID: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    CLIENT_SECRET: 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
};



Update your app.js:

Replace the hardcoded credentials with:
javascriptCopyconst CLIENT_ID = config.CLIENT_ID;
const CLIENT_SECRET = config.CLIENT_SECRET;



Update your index.html:

Add the config file before your main script:
htmlCopy<script src="config.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>



Create a .gitignore file:

Add config.js to this file to prevent it from being pushed to GitHub.


Create a README.md file with the following content:

2. Create a Spotify Developer account and register your application to get your Client ID and Client Secret.

3. Create a `config.js` file in the root directory with the following content:
```javascript
const config = {
    CLIENT_ID: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',

Note
This project requires a web server to run properly due to CORS restrictions when making API requests. You can use a simple HTTP server like Python's http.server or Node.js http-server.
For Python:
Copypython -m http.server 8000
For Node.js:

Install http-server: npm install -g http-server
Run: http-server

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

8. Package your files:
   - Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:
     - `index.html`
     - `styles.css`
     - `app.js`
     - `README.md`
     - `.gitignore`

9. Push your changes to GitHub:
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare project for submission"
git push origin main
Copy
10. Share your GitHub repository link:
 - This is what you'll submit. The repository should contain all necessary files except `config.js`.

By following these steps, anyone who clones your repository can set up and run your project by following the instructions in the README, without exposing your personal API credentials. They'll need to use their own Spotify API credentials in the `config.js` file.

This approach ensures that your project is secure, easily shareable, and runnable on other systems. It also provides clear instructions for setup and usage, which is crucial for project evaluation.
